As a beginner, I'm looking for the translation of a french word into a breton word. 
I need to enter a french word.
I need to launch a search for the translation into breton.
I need to see all results that contain the word.
I need to see the translated word highlighted.
I need to understand what each result means, ie the french translation should be next to the breton sentence.
I need to understand what the meaning of each breton word from the results,
either by expanding details or having a research-like: breton to french.
I need to access collateral information, eg tenses for a verb.

Constraints:
- results may be words or sentences that contain the word.
- mutations change the word (in sentences).
